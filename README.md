# Pagekit Enforce Rewrite URL

Some web hoster use prefixes for environment variables which makes it impossible for pagekit to recognize if mod_rewrite is enabled. This extension enforces rewritten urls.

WARNING: Use this extension only if your website also works without the 'index.php' in urls!

## Installation

Please install Enforce Rewrite URL via the built-in Marketplace in your Pagekit installation.
